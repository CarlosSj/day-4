# Reminders
How to find the answers:
- First ask Google
- Then ask your table-mates
- Then ask Nabil or Sean

Don't be afraid to experiment! There's no penalty for getting code wrong. You can always change it again if you don't get the result you want.

# Group debugging
I've written some buggy code. Let's fix it together!

If you want to follow along, clone this repository. From your `code-forward` folder:
`git clone https://github.com/code-forward/day-4`

# Free coding
This is really free time for you to finish exercises you didn't have a chance to earlier this week, or to create something new and cool and put it up online!

If you don't feel inspired, here are a few ideas:
- Play [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/) to sharpen your CSS skills
- Write `fizzbuzz` in JavaScript, a standard interview question to write a function that
  - prints the numbers 1 to 100, except that it instead
  - prints "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
  - prints "buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
  - prints "fizzbuzz" if the number is divisible by both
- Challenge: look up "recursion" online and try implementing `factorial`.
- Super bonus challenge: if you get `factorial` working, try `fibonacci` next. If you write it, try calling it with a large argument like 100 or 1000. What happens? Why do you think that is? Can you figure out how to fix it?

# Project discussions
On Monday we'll get into our groups and start building our applications for the showcase event on Friday!

Let's have people come up and pitch their ideas.

Take some time over the weekend to think about what you want to do. Just be aware that you might not get to work with your best friend this week!
